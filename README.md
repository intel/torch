If you have an ongoing need to use this project, are interested in independently developing it, or would like to maintain patches for the open source software community, please create your own fork of this project. 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/torch/distro.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/torch/distro)

Torch*
============
Torch is a scientific computing framework with wide support for machine learning algorithms. It is easy to use and efficient, thanks to an easy and fast scripting language, LuaJIT, and an underlying C/CUDA implementation.

Intel®Software Optimization for Torch
============
This fork is dedicated to improving Torch performance when running on CPU, in particular Intel® Xeon processors (HSW, BDW, Xeon Phi)


### Requirements
If you are root user, please use this command to install OpenBlas and other dependency: 
```sh
bash install-deps
```

If you are not root user, please use this command to install OpenBlas from source code, and this script will add OpenBLAS to LD_LIBRARY_PATH automaticly.
```sh
. ./install-openblas.sh
```

### Building
Install this repo, which installs the torch distribution, with a lot of nice goodies. 

You can specify which compiler to compile the project, and the default compiler is gcc & g++.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/intel/torch.git ~/torch
cd ~/torch; bash install-deps;
./install.sh        #use gcc to install torch
./install.sh icc  #use icc to install torch
```

By default Torch will install LuaJIT 2.1. If you want other options, you can use the command:
```sh
TORCH_LUA_VERSION=LUA51 ./install.sh
TORCH_LUA_VERSION=LUA52 ./install.sh
```


### Cleaning
To remove all the temporary compilation files you can run:
```sh
./clean.sh
```

### Test
You can test that all libraries are installed properly by running:
```sh
./test.sh
```
Tested on Ubuntu 14.04, CentOS 7.

### More build options for install.sh

```sh
./install.sh [gcc] [avx512] [mklml] [noskip]
```

*  icc/gcc,    default gcc
*  avx512/off, default off, avx512 will force compilers(GCC version should be greater than 4.9.2) to use AVX512F instructions to compile the framework. 
*  mklml/mkl,  default mkl.
*  noskip/skip,default noskip, skip means skip the openblas checking  

If you want to use MKL as the default BLAS library, please activate MKL before install.sh:
```sh
source /opt/intel/mkl/bin/mklvars.sh intel64
```
